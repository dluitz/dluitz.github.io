The easiest way to contact me is by sending an email to *dluitz at illinois dot edu*.

Physically, you can find me in my office 3135 in the Engineering Sciences Building on the campus of the U of I, just north of the MRL, which is north of the Loomis laboratory of Physics.

I am on [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Luitz) and have a public [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8CCqRZYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
